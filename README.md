# Cloud Native Computing Foundation Lab Overview

## Introduction

To better understand the [Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) and its diverse projects and products, I started this personal lab.
The goal is to select and combine various CNCF products and services into a cohesive, functional solution.

This repository provides a brief overview of the products and services used, along with the architectural landscape of the solution.
